# Elevate-Labs-Task-7

The objective of this task was to use SQL inside Python to run queries, output them and create a bar chart visualization. The database manaagement tool I used was MYSQL and I did this after establishing a connection between my IDLE Python and MYSQL Workbench. I used the expense_tracker database on my MYSQL Workbench to extract the queries on the expenses table. A vertical bar chart was created from my queries.
